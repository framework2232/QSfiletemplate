## PURPOSE
#### _Developed as a quick folder / file builder for static HTML/CSS website._

* This script is for anyone who is building a website from complete scratch using HTML and CSS.
* This python script will build a common folder structure and add basic files.
   * empty ___index.html___ inside root folder
   * empty ___style.css___ inside __css__ folder
   * empty ___img___ folder
* The script reduces time in the basic setup of file structure as the folders and files are ready to go.
* This script is designed to be run as the first part of the process of writting the website.
* The files are built in a folder named ___/webSite/___ in your current drive. If the folder already exists, the script wont run. This is to prevent existing files being accidently over written. Running the script with its default settings, the result is:
   * __/webSite/css/style.css__
   * __/webSite/img/__
   * __/webSite/index.html__
   * __/webSite/main.js__
   * __/webSite/manifest.json__
   * __/webSite/robots.txt__

</p>

* ___Above:__ Image shows all buttons green, therefore when 'BUILD' is selected, all files and folders will be made (default)._

</p>

* ___Above:__ Image shows the red buttons have been deselected, therefore only the green files and folders will be made. On the right the diagram has selected files in green, and deselected files in grey._

---
3. After selecting 'BUILD':
  * If the folders and files __DO__ already exist, an error messagebox will be displayed and file manager window opened. This is to prevent any existing files being accidently overwritten. 
  * If the folders and files __DON'T__ already exist, the script builds the selected files, opens file manager and displays the new folders and files.

## HOW THE SCRIPT WORKS

__1.__ Script declares variables and calls definitions:
```python
folder = '/webSite/'
file = 'index.html'
makeMyFolder(folder)
makeMyFile(folder, file)
```

__2.__ If the folder _DOES NOT_ already exist, the folder is made:
```python
def makeMyFolder(folder):
    if not os.path.exists(folder):
        os.makedirs(folder)
        print('Made your folder: ' + folder)
```

__3.__ If the folder _DOES_ exist, an error messagebox is displayed:
```python
def build():     
    if os.path.exists(folderName):        
        print('Warning box displayed: '+folderName+' already exists.')    
        tkinter.messagebox.showerror("Overwrite WARNING", appOverwriteWarning)
        filedialog.askopenfilename(initialdir="/", title="Move or Rename Folder: "+ folderName)
    else:                
```

__4.__ The empty file is built in the appropriate directory.
```python
def makeMyFile(folder, file):
    os.chdir(folder)
    with open(file,'w') as f:
        f.write('')
        print('Built: '+ file)
```
